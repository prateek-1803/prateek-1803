# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there! 👋 I'm Prateek Kumar Khandelwal, a Computer Science undergraduate at BIT Mesra. I'm passionate about competitive programming and exploring the exciting world of Data Science and Natural Language Processing. Welcome to my GitHub profile, where you can find a collection of my projects, contributions, and explorations in these fields.

## About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on enhancing my problem-solving skills through competitive programming challenges.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning and experimenting with various data science and NLP tools and techniques.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to algorithms, data structures, or data science concepts.
- 📫 How to reach me: prateekkhandelwal0000@gmail.com(mailto:prateekkhandelwal0000@gmail.com)

## My Interests

- Competitive Programming: I love participating in coding contests on platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode. Solving algorithmic puzzles challenges me to think critically and creatively.
- Data Science: I'm enthusiastic about exploring data, uncovering insights, and building predictive models. From data cleaning to machine learning, I find joy in every step of the data science process.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP opens up a world of possibilities where computers can understand and analyze human language. I'm fascinated by the power of NLP in sentiment analysis, text summarisation , and language translation.

## Projects

Here are some of the exciting projects I've been working on:

1. **ChatGPT Reviews**
   - Description: A website that uses ChatGPT to summarise college reviews.Reviews are scraped from Collegedunia using beautifulsoup. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Topic Modelling to extract major topics from reviews. Used Langchain framework to integrate with ChatGPT. Nextjs framework for website
   - Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, matplotlib, Natural Language toolkit(NLTK), OpenAI, Langchain, Nextjs, Beautiful-soup
   - Website link: ChatGPT Reviews(https://collegegpt-flame.vercel.app/)
   - Webscraped Dataset link: Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prateekkhandelwal18/indian-college-reviews)
   - Topic Modelling Notebook link: Notebook(https://www.kaggle.com/code/prateekkhandelwal18/topic-modelling-indian-college-reviews)

**Other projects pinned below**

- Programming Languages: C++, Python, SQL
